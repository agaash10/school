<b><br><p class="para">I been playing soccer for a long long time.Soccer is one of the big charactristics in my life I can play for hours at a time.I have been playing since the gae of 6 I played in house leagues across scarbrough and toronto for example the scarbrough rangers where when i was older I played rep. As a goal keeper and my true passion position CENTER BACK I have then moved to a bigger team at the age of 9 and 10 where I had a medical problem and has stopped playing out of school soccer.This caused me to have a spiral downfall from my potentioal I then went on to play for school teams from grade 4-8 Maybe in some games in a men league where I sat on there bench and came in if they needed someone.In the summer of 2021 there was the euro cup and I watched it and felt my passion again I went to the park and chucked shots by myself for hours and my passion just came back.</p><br></b>
